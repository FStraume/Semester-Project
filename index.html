            <p>Over the course of human history, science has developed 
                from our earlyunderstanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to 
                exploringeverything from galaxies
                 far away to the very building blocks of life itself.</p>

            <p>The aim of our museum is to create a space where
                everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries
                and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion
                to continue the exploration of the world around us.</p>

            <p>We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits.
                This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore.
                Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life</p>
