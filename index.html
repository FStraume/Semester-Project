                <p>Over the course of human history, science has developed 
                    from our earlyunderstanding of fire, wind, water, and earth to 
                    exploringeverything from galaxies
                     far away to the very building blocks of life itself.</p>

                <p>The aim of our museum is to create a space where
                    everyone can experience the wonders of our discoveries
                    and perhaps even ignite a lifelong passion
                    to continue the exploration of the world around us.</p>

                <p>We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought to live through exhibits.
                    This is why we have over 1000 different exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore.
                    Many of these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around to see science come to life</p>
